        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>"Tracks" takes after its predecessors (Bioshock, Dishonored, etc.), making the game a linear, story based shooter that includes abilities. 
            Each train car is meant to embody a different deadly sin and each train car employs some new mechanic or bullet type. 
            Players must scrounge each train car for ammo and health, and attempt to rid the train of any trespassers.
            <br></br>
        <h3>Theme and Setting</h3>
        <p>The story takes place in a fantasy version of the Wild West in which augmentations and technology are more prevalent and wicked. 
            The player gets to explore different train cars, fighting through enemies and gaining new allies.
