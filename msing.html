        You are Mr. Tinker Tailor,  a plain and simple dressmaker. 
        Except you're not so plain and simple after all, that's just part of your cover as a covert agent employed by your country's powerful intelligence agency.
        <br><br>
        This time you've been contacted for a mission of dire importance. Your organization's top operative, the marvelous Ms. Ing, has mysteriously vanished during her last operation!
        <br><br>
        Your assignment is to outfit the agents who will be infiltrating the prestigious annual debutante ball. Here they hope to find information vital to the rescue of Ms. Ing, and they need you to properly equip them.
        <br><br>
        Dress your spies and watch as they move through the party at the Mansion. When the spies encounter an obstacle they will use the gear that you equip them with and your guidance to get through it.
        <br><br>
        Will you be able to prepare your spies for success? Or will you cause the whole operation to come apart at the seams?
